                Remember how we 1st met in whatsapp? You texted me about your academics..
                Remember when we chat till 2am in kota 😁 for the 1st time ? You were offended because
                I asked you current affairs 🤭 and then you asked me about Einstein 🥺 which I couldn't 
                answer🥹.Then slowly we used to talk a lot and when one of us would leave for the class and
                the other would leave beautiful texts in telegram or whatsapp 😁!
                Slowly I started liking youuu 😁 and I was also feeling that you too loveee me 😁
